From approximately 6 million crashes a year, over 35,000 crashes are fatal.\nTo imporve the country's road safety, it is important to understand the the causes of accidents as well as the conditions leading to the incident.\n\nMoreover, understanding the factors prior to the incidents through graphical and statistical analysis, including the level of severity, liklihood of collisions, and probaility of injury; can\nfurther improve the education sector within road safety as well as give governmental bodies the data needed to build safer roads and raise awareness of the main factors and conditions leading to road incidents.\n\nThe aim of this project is to use publicly available data- published by the Seattle Deport of Transportation (SDOT) in the form of a dataset, to indentify the relevant information that allow for the comprehension\non the number, injuries, and severity of collision occur in Seattle.\n\nThe data will be analysed mathematically and graphically through data science methodologies such as data visualisation tools and machine learning models in order to provide insight on traffic collisions in Seattle.\n\n##Data Understanding\nThe data used througout this project is extracted from the SDOT's website entitled \"Collisions-All Years\". This dataset includes all types of collisions, whether be vehicle, bicycle or pedestrian, filed by the\nSeattle Police Department. \n\nThe dataset provided includes 65,000 collisions from 2004 to present day, updated on a weekly basis. The severity is also an important factor that is incorporated within the collisions dataset with 5 codes, explained:\n- 0: unknown\n- 1: property damage\n- 2: injury\n- 2b: serious injury\n- 3: fatality\n\nThe actual dataset only includes codes 1 and 2 without the inclusion of any other alternatives; but gives 37 attributes related to the collisions reported such as day, time, month, weather etc. All of which will be used \nto build our model and explain trends related to traffic collisions.\n\nThe full description of the data can be found at: https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Metadata.pdf\n\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": ""}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "\n", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.6", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.6.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
